      <p>
        I use react or Vue with TypeScript to develop websites and excel in UI/UX design and web animation production.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started learning front-end around 2022. I believe that creating webs is an art, so I founded an Instagram social media to share tutorials on front-end effects. Within six months, it attracted over 2000 followers.
      </p>
      <p> In the future, I want to promote the front-end artistic effects in Taiwan, To make Taiwanese webpages more interesting.</p>
